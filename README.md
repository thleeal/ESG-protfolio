Profitability of long-short ESG portfolio
Here, I construct a portfolio consisting of at least 30 stocks, taking a long position in stocks with high ESG ratings and a short position in stocks with low ESG ratings (e.g., long 15 stocks and short 15 stocks). Track the performance of the ESG portfolio over time and compute the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio
